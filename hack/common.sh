## image_exists_in_repo IMAGE_URI
#
# Checks whether IMAGE_URI -- e.g. quay.io/app-sre/osd-metrics-exporter:abcd123
# -- exists in the remote repository.
# If so, returns success.
# If the image does not exist, but the query was otherwise successful, returns
# failure.
# If the query fails for any reason, prints an error and *exits* nonzero.
